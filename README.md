<h1>Overview</h1>
<h2>Goal</h2>
<p>To create a tool that turns technical medical data into easy-to-understand language to
help patients better understand their health status and align their main concerns with their
doctor’s.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Chosen target group: Paediatric patients</h2>
To make our target group understand more about their medical condition to promote
increased compliance with medication and surgical recommendations.
<br/>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>Our team created a virtual pal named Sofia for the patients. This way, they will be able to
relate better with the companion and feel more reassured that the patient has a virtual pal
who is going through the same thing they are going through.<p>
  
<h2>Sofia's features</h2>
<ul>1. Log in/Sign up page
It allows for personalisation of accessibility options and fast access to personal information -
even hospital information - in future versions. Two-step authentication in future
implementations as well to ensure the safety of the patients data.</ul>
<ul>2. Call the Doctor!
After collecting the information that belongs to the patient, the app will also collect
information from the Doctor in-charge of the patient and this button will allow
quick/emergency access to call the doctor through a channel of the patient's choice (i.e.
direct call for urgent situations/Whatsapp for casual communication).</ul>
<ul>3. Sofia’s World
A feature that allows the patient to directly interact with their new friend, Sofia. There are
several features that it comes with.
<ol>a. Ask Sofia Questions
This feature contains a chatbot that can share information regarding cancers and
other terminal illnesses to educate and enrich the patient whenever they are curious.
The content will be filtered appropriately and the chatbot provides a positive and
optimistic perspective of their condition.</ol>

<ol>b. SmartyPal
A point-collecting feature to test the patients of their knowledge on various
health-related topics. The content quizzed will be easy and explained in the ‘Ask
Sofia Questions’ feature.</ol>

<ol>c. Talk to People like Sofia!
This button links the patient to an external social media so that the patient can
possibly reach out to their friends and/or people who have experiences/are
experiencing the same thing. This can boost their morale and outlook on life</ol></ul>
